# Welcome to the House Marketplace project repository on GitHub!

It's a web application where people can come and register and list their home or apartment for rent or for sale. They can also add it as a special offer.

This repository contains a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application that was created as part of a learning project. The application was built using the following libraries and tools:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): A comprehensive mobile and web application development platform that provides various services including real-time database, authentication, and hosting.
- [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/): A React wrapper for the popular Leaflet JavaScript library, which is used to create interactive maps.
- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/): A lightweight, mobile-friendly touch slider library that can be used to create swipeable carousels or galleries.
- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid): A library for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).
